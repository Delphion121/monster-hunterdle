                An elder dragon that soars at very high altitudes far from human habitation. 
                Its flaming red wings are often the only visible sign of it, giving rise to its nickname, the Argent Comet. 
                Those wings aren't just for flying, though, and are easily used to stab, rend and blow away its enemies. 
                Occasionally, one can find the scorched shells it has left behind.
