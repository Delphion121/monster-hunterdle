# Monstle

A Worlde-esque game but with Monsters from Monster Hunter. Use your Monster Hunter knowledge alongside each guess to hone in the random monster each day. Guess Monsters from all the mainline games. I love playing Wordle based games and I love Monster Hunter. So why not make my own to test out how good I am at guessing Monsters. (Quite bad but got good after making this game). 

> [!Warning]
> **Wilds is planned but currently NOT included.**

> [!NOTE]
> **Which Monster Hunter Games are included?** For this game, I am only including the mainline games with _some_ exceptions. Spinoff games like the mobile games or Monster Hunter Stories are not counted in any way. Additionally, the Online games are not included _unless_ a monster that originated from those games made it into a mainline game like Espinas. 
- To make it a little easier to guess, I am splitting up big game expansions. Yeah, Sunbreak is Rise's expansion, but Malzeno's first appearance is still Sunbreak. This will also count towards a monster's total appearance count. (Magnamalo's first appearance is Rise. He also appeared in Sunbreak. He has 2 total appearances.)

- When taking a look at a Monster's information, I am taking their most _recent_ game. (Not including Wilds at the moment). BUT on a certain things, I will include old/outdated elements, ailments, etc. if they are relevant. Think Brachydios Slime.
- Green means that specific metric is correct, red is incorrect, yellow is partially correct. Usually only helpful for Element and Ailment since monsters can have more than one of these. 
- An arrow will indicate if your guess is higher or lower than the correct amount for Subspecies or Total Appearances.
- **About Subspecies and Deviants...** There's... a lot. I know that a lot of players have a special love (or hate) for certain subspecies just to be relegated to a number. Trust me, I love Blood Orange Bishaten, too - but many subspecies originate in the same game as their main counterpart, have the same ailments/elements, have hard to remember origins, etc. It can quickly go from, "Aha! It's obviously Rathalos!" to "Wait, was what the name of that Rathalos subspecies?" real quick. So subspecies will be its own metric. **Deviants and Variants however...** I feel are distinct enough to be separate monsters. Think Raging Brachydios or Ruiner Nergigante. If you want a list of the ones I included, here they are:
  - Scarred Yian Garuga
  - Rusted Kushala
  - Furious Rajang
  - Savage Deviljho
  - Chaotic Gore Magala
  - Raging Brachydios
  - Shrieking Legiana
  - Seething Bazelgeuse
  - Blackviel Vaal Hazak
  - Ruiner Nergigante
  - Frostfang Barioth
  - Crimson Glow Valstrax
  - Narwa Allmother
  - Scorned Magnamalo
  - Primordial Malzeno
  - All Deviants from Generations and Generations Ultimate.

- Some monsters have a lot of stuff going on. Looking at you, Alatreon. Hover over any of the boxes to make something a bit more readable.
- _Technically_ there's a little info tab and tutorial, but those are placeholders at the moment.
- When you correctly guess the monster, you get a neat little description of the monster.
- When you press the info button, the character that pops up is my character from Rise.
- I main Bow.
- Brachydios and Hellblade Glavenous are my two favorite monsters. I have a Brachydios tattoo!
- If you want to cheat/give up. Inspect the page for the answer.
- Deviljho is considered a pickle.
